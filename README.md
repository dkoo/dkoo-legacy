My personal website and blog, with a custom CMS running on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).

## Why reinvent the CMS wheel?

Teach a man to fish, etc.

## Current features

The minimum amount of stuff that matters to me, as a writer:

* **Fast, reactive data rendering** courtesy the Meteor framework
* **Single page app structure** with client-based routing and automated post permalinks, courtesy [Iron Router](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router)
* **Markdown-based editing** for fast composition and formatting
* **Public/private post status** for stress-free drafting
* **Post scheduling** for those times Iâ€™m feeling prolific
* **Inline editing** of every post field, including title, content, permalink slug, excerpt, publish date and time, and status
* **Reactive search** with a simple, single-input UI
* **dynamic, per-page SEO optimization** courtesy [MS-SEO](https://github.com/DerMambo/ms-seo)
